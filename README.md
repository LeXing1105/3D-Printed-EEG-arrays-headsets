# 3D-Printed-EEG-arrays-headsets

This Repository includes 3D-printed models and prototypes of

(1) a Full-head EEG headset; 

(2) Forehead and back of the head electrode arrays; 

(3) Behind-the-ear electrode arrays;

(4) the individual flat or fingered electrodes for array assembly.

**The models (.stl files) are in the Model folder, the pictures of printed prototypes are also provided in this folder.**


Flexible printing filaments can be used for making those models. I used commercially available TPU filaments to make them in my own cases. For electrode manufacturing, we have different options for making Ag/AgCl coated electrodes, directly conductive electrodes, or something else, based on the resources and applications.
